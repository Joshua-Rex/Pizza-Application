Listen bro, I dunno. You're probably coming back to this confused, but if it helps. You don't have a clue what is going on here in the moment. The things we've pinned down. 
- client/src/App.js is your front end. It's where all your HTML will go
- container/index.js is your back end. It's where your data storage and calls will happen from what I can tell.
- We've got an image set up, but don't know if we can update it, but if you run the container and then run the App, you will get a webpage connected to the backend
- Decide where to store the information, it's easier if in the backend but probably harder to alter for admin side
- If it's stored in the app, in const arrays, it'll be easier to edit but probably a security risk, etc.
- Good luck
