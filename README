Listen bro, I dunno. You're probably coming back to this confused, but if it helps. You don't have a clue what is going on here in the moment. The things we've pinned down. 
- client/src/App.js is your front end. It's where all your HTML will go
- container/index.js is your back end. It's where your data storage and calls will happen from what I can tell.
- We've got an image set up, but don't know if we can update it, but if you run the container and then run the App, you will get a webpage connected to the backend
- Decide where to store the information, it's easier if in the backend but probably harder to alter for admin side
- If it's stored in the app, in const arrays, it'll be easier to edit but probably a security risk, etc.
- Good luck

New information:
- Store all the pizza's into an array (seperated between normal pizza's, vegetarian and gluten free)
- Retrieve the amount of pizza's for each section and create a pizza box for each pizza in that section
- Apply the information for the pizza's in the box using the value of the array (if this doesn't work, seperate all the features of the array like pizza name, description, calories and give them all a primary key to refer them all to each other)
- To do after is implement the customisation button and the mix and match pizza option.
